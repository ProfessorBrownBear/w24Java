Below is a Java program that demonstrates two distinct applications of arrays, 
one with numbers and the other with strings.

### Java Program

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Application 1: Numbers - Finding the average of an array of numbers
        double[] numbers = {10.5, 20.3, 30.2, 40.7, 50.8};
        double sum = 0;
        for (double num : numbers) {
		System.out.println("num is " + num);
		System.out.println("sum is " +  sum);
            	sum += num;
        }
        double average = sum / numbers.length;
        System.out.println("Average of numbers: " + average);

        // Application 2: Strings - Concatenating strings from an array
        String[] words = {"Hello", "World", "from", "Java"};
        StringBuilder sentence = new StringBuilder();
        for (String word : words) {
            sentence.append(word).append(" ");
        }
        System.out.println("Concatenated sentence: " + sentence.toString().trim());
    }
}

### Explanation

1. **Application with Numbers**: 
   - The program creates an array of double values (`numbers`).
   - It then calculates the average of these numbers by iterating through the array, summing the values, and dividing by the length of the array.
   - The average is printed to the console.

2. **Application with Strings**: 
   - The program also has an array of Strings (`words`).
   - It concatenates all the strings in the array into a single sentence.
   - This is achieved using a `StringBuilder` to efficiently append each string in the array, adding a space after each word.
   - The final concatenated sentence is printed to the console.

This program showcases basic yet practical uses of arrays with numbers and strings in Java.
